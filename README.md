# MIPS-single-cycle
Here you can find the resources I made in the process of designing a MIPS like CPU. I've made them for myself so they are not easy to understand.
In 'surse' you can find the VHDL code that describes the architecture.
The bitsteam is ready to be loaded on a FPGA code to test the CPU in action.
